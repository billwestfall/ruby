From Writing Great Specifications by Nicieja

some notes:

1) starts with exmples that really focus on one user , active voice scenario, to more generic, passive voice scenarios so that they scale better.  there's no doubting that these approaches are in direct conflict with each other and you must choose one (or a middle ground)
2) in chapter 5 , references that Gherkin may not be good for end users. yet most of the preceding chapters deal with making the scenarios human readable. why focus on readability when end users do not like the format anyway?
3) in chapter 5 mention of you don't have to get layout right first time. Nobel thought, but seems to conflict with the more prescriptive preceding steps on active/passive, specific/generic and scenarios vs outlines
